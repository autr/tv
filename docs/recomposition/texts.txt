SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VIDEO ARTIST
Pays rent, tools for new works

same for everyone

I earn money = I give it to my landlord
60% of my existence, is for my landlord etc
Then they pay people to threaten you lol

ranting now

for most people, this is the one part of life
where you get to experience Full On Capitalism
in the US, I guess healthcare too, but UK / EU
you can happily live your life, working away
doo di doo di doo, and the one element of life
where it's gangster shit, is housing

goddamn, that IG thing, Swedish prison or London flat
200K breach of UN / EHCR legislation, even here though
I don't think in prison I would be allowed to drink
poisoned water, that makes me shit, and cramp up
room inspection was the same though, the guard just
had nicer shoes, and a salmon pink scarf

I suppose if the government handle housing, then
they get to put lots of cameras and microphones in
and if the free market handles housing, then they 
do the same, but are just jacking off to you going
to the toilet, and charging 1200EU for the privilege
I'll take my chances with a bald man inside the wall

right I've got four hours? I suppose:

1) prep photos 1700
	1.1 favourite them
	1.2 photomator presets
	1.3 exporttttttt
2) whack them into website 1700
3) make page real quick  1800
4) fuck fuck fuck PayPal 1800
5) wangle those over to IG (slow) 1900
6) spend 30 minutes rethinking text 1900
